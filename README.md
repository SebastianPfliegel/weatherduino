# WeatherDuino

Small indoor weather station based on Arduino

## Project

This is a short sample project done quick by popular demand of my colleagues in the office. It consists of three components:

1. `Arduino` Nano + DHT22 Temperature/Humidity sensor
2. `ASP.NET` Core JSON API as provider of the sensor values
3. `Electron` app as consumer of the JSON API
